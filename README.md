# Forecasting_Spatial_Temporal_Demand_for_Food_Delivery
CS Capstone in 24Fall with Feiluan, supervised by Zhibin Chen

Keywords: Machine Learning, Demand forecasting, Transportation, Estimation, Predictive models

Methods: Data Preprocessing, LSTM-PDP, ConvLSTM, H3

This project is inspired by the [Meituan-INFORMS-TSL-Research-Challenge](https://github.com/meituan/Meituan-INFORMS-TSL-Research-Challenge.git),
which is one of the questions raised by Chinaâ€™s largest food delivery platform
Meituan focuses on the optimization of the on-demand food delivery system. As
Computer Science students, we are interested in transportation development
and optimization. Along with the background knowledge of machine learning,
we select the topic of forecasting the spatial and temporal distributions of future
orders and do deeper research in it. We hope our research could propose
some ideas for optimizing the food delivery system in this direction, achieving
system efficiency improvement.
